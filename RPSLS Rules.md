Simple, right? Well, I sure hope it is. It could be a little confusing at first, but once you play the game for a bit, you should get the hang of it, let's move on.

## How to Start

We're going to go through this in steps, based on what your option is that you choose, you have the option to play with a Command Line Interface or a Graphical User Interface, by simply typing in CLI or GUI at the start of the program

## How to play with CLI

If you select a Command Line Interface, here's how the game will work

- Step 1: Enter number 1 for a Human vs AI game, or number 2 for a Human vs Human game
- Step 2: Enter the name of the player or players, depending on what mode you select
- Step 3: If you're playing Human vs AI, enter in what gesture you want to select, if your gesture beats the AI's gesture, you win! Run the game again to try another round, if you're playing Human vs Human, Let the first player enter their gesture, then the second player, make sure to look away while your opponent is picking! We don't like cheaters here. Whoever picks the gesture that beats the other wins! And you can run the game again for another round.

## How to play with GUI

If you select a Graphical User Interface, here's how the game will work

There's not much different instruction to be given really! It's pretty much the same steps as a CLI, but you'll have some buttons and text boxes to guide you on through it, making it a lot better to look at and simple to play.
